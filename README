Permio is a script that generates a gallery of images.

The script assumes that all images are in the images/ directory. 
You would also want to edit gallery.erb.
You should also download Galleria[1] into the root directory.

Run it using this command: ruby generate_html.rb > gallery.html

All of the code is released under the MIT/X11 license[2].
